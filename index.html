    <h1><big>A 3-Team Trade to Land LaMelo Ball with the Lakers and Supercharge Hornets' Rebuild</big></h1>
    <!-- margin = space ROUND an element-->
     <div id="box1">The Lakers are the obvious risk-takers here. Charlotte essentially cleans out the Lakers' future draft cache, leaving Los Angeles wholly invested in the present roster. LaMelo Ball is worth it, though. If not for injuries, in fact, there wouldn't be much to argue here. LaMelo raises the Lakers' floor and their ceiling. He elevates teammates, works well in a complementary role, and supplies Los Angeles with a bankable point guard (finally!).</div>
     <div id="box2">The Lakers aren't giving up much beyond their draft picks. Jalen Hood-Schifino is hopelessly buried in the depth chart, the Gabe Vincent signing was a bust, and Dalton Knecht is a fine prospect, but he's not going to meaningfully improve the Lakers' competitive odds. Rui Hachimura is the standout in terms of outgoing players, but between his contract ($17 million) and his inconsistency on defense, teams aren't falling over themselves to acquire the 26-year-old.</div>
